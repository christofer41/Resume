                <h3>Hello!</h3>
                <p>Thank you for taking time to read my resume! <br> My name is Christofer Carlsson and I am 25 years old.</p>
                <p>I have been living together with my wife for over 6 years now, and I have always been passionate about programing.</p>
                <p>I have been a bit of a "Jack of all trade" and done a lot of different types of jobs, not only in the branch of programing.</p>
                <p>But after working here and there, I always went back to my hobby of building things with the use of code.</p>
                <p>And after alot of thinking I finally decided to make my hobby into my real profession, and after a magical journey, here I am!</p>
                <p>I hope that you enjoy reading through my resume, and if you have any question please contact my through the website!</p>
                <p>Have a wonderful day!</p>
                <h3>With love // Christofer Carlsson</h3>
